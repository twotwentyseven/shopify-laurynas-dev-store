            "answer": "<p>We want to bring the best at-home coffee experience possible, but realised our old bags weren’t working for you. So, we landed on a whole new type of packaging in two new sizes - 100g and 340g. We reckon the larger 340g size is the perfect months’ supply. The 100g, a size suited to your weekend sampling sessions – and an easy way to try something new if you’re not quite ready to commit.<\/p>"

            "question": "Why have you increased your pricing?",
            "answer": "<p>There’s been a huge increase in the worldwide cost of coffee. Challenging conditions in coffee-growing regions have forced prices up everywhere. Shipping rates within our supply chain have blown up.  <br\/><br\/>We made every effort to try and absorb these growing costs, working harder and smarter wherever possible. But reality had to bite sooner or later. <br\/><br\/>That said, with a small price increase comes huge investment in your coffee experience. You’ll start to notice some changes soon, perhaps you already have, allowing us to share more of our knowledge with you (for free), new coffees, and a bigger and better loyalty programme.<\/p>"
